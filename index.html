  <h6>It began with a canvas...</h6>
    <p>A literal canvas. That is how Ethan Marcotte introduced us to the idea of Responsive Web Design in his book, <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a>. Because web design is an art form and art needs a canvas for its medium. We will pretend this is all objective and save us from hours of critiquing surrealism and the idea that "everything is art." Moving on...</p>
    <p>We have to occasionally remind ourselves that the internet hasn't been around for that long (I'm referring to functional internet - complete with search engines and full-spectrum color). In addition, the number of different-sized devices that we use to access the internet have exponentially increased within the last few years as well. The price we pay for trying to be *unique* and *original*. But what does that mean? It means a headache for front-end developers when attempting to design and deliver a wonderful viewing experience. At least decent, on all of those canvases. </p>
    <p>Responsive web design introduces the idea that we can satisfy all of our users with their *unique* and *original* devices with minimal alterations to our original code. Meaning, your beautiful baby of a website will look as pretty and be as functional on your desktop computer as it will on your phone or tablet. It lets the designer ease off of fixed-width constrictions without losing control. Yes, we're all control freaks. But there is a bonus! It also allows you to say you can easily adapt to change because change is good- add <i>that</i> to your LinkedIn! All you'll need to do is include a little of that math you swore off of after college. </p>
